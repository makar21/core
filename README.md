# Local setup

For setting up the project, run the following commands.

    virtualenv .venv -p python3
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Read [here](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/py-driver/en/latest/quickstart.html) about BigchainDB driver dependencies.

You will also need a BigchainDB node.

After you finish the setup, you can use the db module to check everything.
